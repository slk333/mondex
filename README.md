## Getting Valid Dex Data

-   dex data comes from pokeAPI's JSONs
-   for each Pokemon JSON, I parsed and loaded into it memory
-   I transformed the complex pokemon record into a simple record with 5 fields
-   I pushed the 151 records into an array and saved it to JSON
-   I specified the Pokemon type
-   I transfromed the JSON into TS sourcecode
-   I declared the array as an array of Pokemon
-   The service language checked that each record conforms to the type
-   Conclusion: I have a TS array of 151 records with valid data

## Setting the UI for Pokemon data

-   display the sprite with an image of a specific size
-   display the number with some monospace font
-   display the stats with a simple graph or bars
-   display the types through one or two images

## Overall layout and pages

-   a single page for now
